          <h2 class='mb-5'>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
          <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It forms the backbone of any web page and provides the structure for web content. HTML uses a series of elements to enclose different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way.</p>
          <p>HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification published in 1995. HTML5, the latest version, introduced many new elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites.</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Elements:</strong> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. Examples include &lt;div&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;form&gt;, and many more. Elements can be nested within each other to create complex structures.</li>
              <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> HTML attributes provide additional information about elements. For instance, the href attribute in the &lt;a&gt; tag specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. Other attributes include class, id, style, and data-*.</li>
              <li><strong>Forms:</strong> HTML forms are used to collect user input. They include elements like &lt;input&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, and &lt;button&gt;, and attributes like action, method, and enctype to specify how form data should be handled.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Key Features</h3>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Semantic Elements:</strong> HTML5 introduced semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;section&gt; that help define the structure of web pages more clearly.</li>
              <li><strong>Multimedia Support:</strong> HTML5 provides native support for audio and video embedding using &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements, making it easier to include multimedia content without plugins.</li>
              <li><strong>Graphics and Effects:</strong> HTML5 includes support for 2D drawing via the &lt;canvas&gt; element and scalable vector graphics (SVG) via the &lt;svg&gt; element.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Usage</h3>
          <p>HTML is used to structure content on the web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content and allows for the creation of structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. Web developers use HTML to build websites and web applications.</p>
          <h3>Benefits</h3>
          <ul>
